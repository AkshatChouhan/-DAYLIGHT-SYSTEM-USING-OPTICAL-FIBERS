# DAYLIGHT SYSTEM USING OPTICAL FIBERS
Solar day lighting through optical fiber cables in home and working place is a potential option 
to save energy associated with artificial lighting as well as enhance the visual comfort and 
human health by using natural solar lighting. In this study solar light system consists of optical
fiber and Plano convex lens was designed to bring sunlight into buildings. The effect of optical 
fiber diameter on the intensity and uniformity of light has been analysed and discussed. This 
clean technology can reduce energy cost and contribute to solve climate change issues. Fiber 
Optic day lighting system is an innovative method to capture and transmit the excess sunlight 
available outside to illuminate the interior of buildings. In the present situation, the usage of 
renewable energy resource to conserve energy and reduce pollution is an important agenda for 
many national governments. In addition, numerous studies have demonstrated that natural 
lighting can increase worker productivity and sales, workplace satisfaction and has numerous
health benefits.
